# PTKTest
This is a test version of Parametric Toolkit (PTK).

I (Bunji) just made these components as my interpretation of PTK python version. 
You could freely use, extract parts which are useful for the real development.

I made the components equivalent for "Family Maker", "Family Gatherer" and some utility components for extracting node and element information.
